//! # Orchestrator Life Cycle Integration Tests
//!
//! This module contains integration tests that validate the complete life cycle
//! of the orchestrator, including startup, task processing, and shutdown scenarios.
//! The primary focus is ensuring the orchestrator can gracefully shut down even
//! when there are pending retries, preventing deadlocks and ensuring operational reliability.

/// **Test: Orchestrator Shutdown with Pending Retries**
///
/// # Purpose
/// This test validates that the orchestrator can shut down gracefully even when there are
/// tasks with pending retry attempts. This addresses the critical deadlock issue where
/// scheduler timeout futures would continue waiting for retry execution while other
/// components were shutting down.
///
/// # Test Scenario
/// 1. **Setup**: Start orchestrator with shepherds
/// 2. **Task Creation**: Create multiple failing tasks with long retry delays (60s)
/// 3. **Wait for First Failures**: Allow tasks to fail their first attempts
/// 4. **Verify Retry State**: Confirm tasks are scheduled for future retries
/// 5. **Shutdown During Pending Retries**: Initiate shutdown while retries are pending
/// 6. **Validate Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure shutdown completes within timeout
///
/// # Expected Behavior
/// - âœ… Tasks should fail their first attempts and enter retry state
/// - âœ… Orchestrator shutdown should complete within 30 seconds (much faster than 60s retry delays)
/// - âœ… No deadlocks or hanging on scheduler timeout futures
/// - âœ… Scheduler timeout futures should be cancelled immediately on shutdown
/// - âœ… ShepherdManager should shut down cleanly
/// - âœ… EventStream should flush and close properly
/// - âœ… **CRITICAL**: Shutdown time < 30s proves timeout future cancellation works correctly
///
/// # What This Test Prevents
/// - **Deadlock on scheduler timeout futures**: Before the fix, timeout futures would continue
///   waiting for retry execution even after shutdown was initiated
/// - **ShepherdManager interaction deadlock**: Schedulers trying to enqueue retries to a
///   shut-down ShepherdManager
/// - **Indefinite shutdown hanging**: Production scenarios where shutdown never completes
///
/// # Test Environment Configuration
/// - **Retry delays**: 60 seconds (much longer than shutdown timeout)
/// - **Shutdown timeout**: 30 seconds via test harness configuration
/// - **Task domain**: Isolated "lifecycle_test" domain
/// - **Multiple tasks**: Ensures concurrent retry scheduling scenarios
