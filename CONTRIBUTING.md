# Contributing to Azolla

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Azolla! It's people like you that make Azolla such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with:
*   **Reporting a bug**
*   **Discussing the current state of the code**
*   **Submitting a fix**
*   **Proposing new features**
*   **Becoming a maintainer**

## Proposing a Change

To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, we kindly request that you open an issue to discuss any new features or significant changes before you begin implementation. This allows for early feedback from the maintainers and community, ensuring your contribution aligns with the project's direction and avoids duplicate effort.

For minor changes or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request directly.

## We Use GitHub Flow

We use GitHub flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints (`cargo fmt`).
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/azolla-io/azolla/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/azolla-io/azolla/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

*   A quick summary and/or background
*   Steps to reproduce
    *   Be specific!
    *   Give sample code if you can.
*   What you expected would happen
*   What actually happens
*   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We use `rustfmt` to format our Rust code. Please run `cargo fmt` before submitting your pull request to ensure your code is formatted correctly.
